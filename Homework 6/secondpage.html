        <p>Once upon a time, there was a couple expecting a child. The wife had cravings for rapunzel, which was found in the garden next door that belonged to a sorceress.</p>

        <p>The wife refused to eat anything else and began to be ill so the Husband snuck in and stole some rapunzel for her. The cravings continue, and the next time the husband snuck over, the sorceress caught him.</p>

        <p>As punishment, when the baby was born she was taken by the sorceress and named Rapunzel after the plant. She grew up to have long golden hair.</p>

        <p>When Rapunzel was twelve, the sorceress locked her in a tower that was hidden in the woods. The sorceress was able to visit her by climbing up her long golden hair.</p>

        <p>Eventually a prince found the tower and went to investigate when he heard singing. She brought him up with her hair and the two eventually fell in love, got secretly married, and planned Rapunzel’s escape.</p>

        <p>However, the sorceress came and when she found out cut Rapunzel’s hair and banished her to the wilderness.</p>

        <p>When the prince comes back that evening the sorceress tricks him with the cut off hair. He then falls from the tower and into thorns that blind him.</p>

        <p>The two eventually find each other after wandering in the forest. Upon reuniting Rapunzel cries and her tears heal the prince's sight. They lived happily ever after.</p>
